== Branches
endif::[]

For the Blech compiler development we use branches and roughly follow the https://gist.github.com/digitaljhelms/4287848[Git/Github branching standards & conventions] 


The contained https://gist.github.com/digitaljhelms/4287848#workflow-diagram[workflow diagram] visualizes this in a nice way.

Since we did not release a stable version until now, we do not have stable branch but only a master branch that reflects the evolution of the language and get tagged from time to time.
