/// Since the abort conditions are pushed into the body of the abort statement
/// conditions may become concurrent in the context of a cobegin in the body.
/// This is a problem if the condition is modified in the body. The scheduler
/// will generate wrong code following the write first-then read strategy.
/// To avoid that we prev all variables which are part of the abort condition
/// and which are modified inside the abort body.
/// In the future we want to generate code for preemptions differently
/// such that prev'ing conditions won't be necessary.
/// This future implementation would introduce another control point which is
/// traversed in every reaction before executing any blocks that correspond to
/// the abort body.
