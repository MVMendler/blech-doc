The title of this post is inspired by Rob Pike's article on [Go at Google: Language Design in the Service of Software Engineering](https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article). 

We started Blech in 2015 to address the problems we observed in the development of embedded, safety-critical, real-time systems.




After a thorough investigation on possible alternatives we decided, that it is worth

We concluded to design a new language suitable for writing embedded, safety-critical, real-time applications, with software engineering considerations that would improve the quality of life of embedded software developers and architects. 



> Programming languages are frozen software engineering knowledge.


## Behaviour over time

Synchronous programming, sequentially constructive

## Mode switching

Control flow instead of state machines

## High coupling

No globals

## Weak typing

## Shared memory concurrency.

## Test culture

## Refactoring and Maintanance
