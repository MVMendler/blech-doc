  Extracting Mode Diagrams from Blech Code
---

A prototypical implementation for extracting and visualizing mode diagrams expressed in the synchronous control-flow of Blech activities has been presented at [Synchron 2021](http://synchron2021.inria.fr/index.html) the *27th International Open Workshop on Sychronous Programming* held in La Rochette 45km south east of the centre of Paris, France.


[On Wednesday, 2021-11-24](http://synchron2021.inria.fr/program.html), [Reinhard von Hanxlden](https://www.rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/en/team/rvh) talked about [Extracting Mode Diagrams from Blech Code](http://synchron2021.inria.fr/slides/synchron2021-vonhanxleden.pdf). 

The [prototypical implementation](https://github.com/blech-lang/blech/tree/feature/mode_diagrams) has been done by Daniel Lucas in [his master thesis](https://rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~biblio/downloads/theses/dalu-mt.pdf). A [research paper on this topic](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9568375) has been publish at the [2021 Forum on Specification, Verification and Design Languages](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9568274/proceeding)
