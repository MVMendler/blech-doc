  Keynote: Elevate embedded real-time programming with a synchronous language
---

At [Memocode 2017](http://memocode.irisa.fr/2017/index.html) the 15th ACM-IEEE International Conference on Formal Methods and Models for System Design held at Technische Universit√§t Wien in Vienna, Austria, the ideas of an imperative synchronous language, later called Blech, have been presented. 

The motivation was and is to create an imperative synchronous language that bridges the gap between model-based control engineering and software engineering.

[In his keynote](http://memocode.irisa.fr/2017/keynotes.html), Franz-Josef Grosch showed how the Blech team intended to [Elevate embedded real-time programming with a synchronous language](http://memocode.irisa.fr/2017/images/Grosch.pdf).
