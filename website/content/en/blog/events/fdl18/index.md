---

At [FDL 2018](http://fdl-conference.org/FDL2018/index.html), the Forum on specification & Design Languages, in Munich, Germany, Blech has been presented to the public for the first time.

In his keynote [Blech - a safe synchronous language for embedded real-time programming](http://fdl-conference.org/FDL2018/program.html#key), Franz-Josef Grosch [motivated and illustrated (slides)](./keynote-fdl-slides.pdf) the requirements and the - at that time planned - features of Blech to bridge the gap between model-based control engineering and modern software engineering.
