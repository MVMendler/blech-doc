description: The Blech modules release
---

Better late then never we announce the release version 0.7.0 of the [Blech compiler](https://github.com/boschresearch/blech/releases/tag/v0.7.0) and the [language services for VS Code](https://github.com/boschresearch/blech-tools/releases/tag/v0.7.0). The code has been released on GitHub already end of June 2021.

Many small things have been fixed and a module system has been added.
Since modules rely on the directory structure of a Blech project, some more tool support is still necessary. Nevertheless modules are now supported by the compiler and the tooling.
