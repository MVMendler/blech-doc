## Branches

For the Blech compiler development we use branches and roughly follow the [Git/Github branching standards & conventions](https://gist.github.com/digitaljhelms/4287848) 


The contained [workflow diagram](https://gist.github.com/digitaljhelms/4287848#workflow-diagram) visualizes this in a nice way.


Since we did not release a stable version until now, we do not have stable branch but only a master branch that reflects the evolution of the language and gets tagged from time to time.
