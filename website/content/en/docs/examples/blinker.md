The first community made demo for Blech is the implementation of a [car's blinker](https://github.com/frameworklabs/blinker) running in a simulated curses environment.
Making use of Blech's reactive programming model and concurrent composition, this example shows how a rather complex state management logic can be decomposed into individual simple building blocks.
