    A Blech demo for the M5StickC programmed in the Arduino environment 

---

[This example](https://github.com/frameworklabs/react) implements a reaction test game for the [M5StickC](https://m5stack.com/products/stick-c) programmed in the Arduino environment with the help of Blech.
Source and build instructions are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/frameworklabs/react). 

It's a nifty piece of work demonstrating how the state flow of the game and the passage of time can be handled in Blech.

Thank you very much [@frameworklabs](https://github.com/frameworklabs).
